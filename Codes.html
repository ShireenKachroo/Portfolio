<p id ="myInformation">
Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm thrilled to have you here. My name is Shireen Kachroo, and I'm a passionate B-Tech Computer Science student on a journey to explore the boundless realms of technology.
<br>
I've always been fascinated by computers and their incredible potential to reshape the world. This fascination led me to pursue a career in computer science, where I try to delve deep into the intricate workings of software, algorithms, and data structures. I am very inquisitive about learning about the rapidly growing field of technology and want to contribute to it through my skills. I am currently working to enhance my coding and problem-solving skills and gain deeper knowledge about the core and basic subjects like DSA, OS, Computer Networks, security, etc.
<br>
Beyond the confines of the classroom, I'm an avid learner who thrives on new challenges and opportunities for growth. Whether it's exploring emerging technologies, or participating in various competitions, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and sharpen my skills. I have also attended many trainings and webinars to get deep knowledge about the field of computer science and enhance my skills to stay industry updated.
<br>
In addition to my technical pursuits, I'm also passionate about giving back to the community and making a positive impact. I believe that technology has the power to transform lives and bridge gaps, and I'm committed to using my skills to create meaningful change.
<br>
When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me immersed in a good book, exploring the great outdoors, or spending quality time with friends and family. I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance and finding joy in the little moments that life has to offer.
<br>

As you delve deeper into my world through my website, I invite you to join me on an exciting voyage of discovery and innovation. Bon voyage, and I can't wait to connect with you further!
